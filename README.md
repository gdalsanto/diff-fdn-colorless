# diff-fdn-colorless  
In this work we introduce an optimization framework to tune a set of Feedback Delay Network (FDN) parameters (feedback matrix, input gains, and output gains) to achieve a smoother and less colored reverberation. 

This is the companion code to the **Feedback Delay Network Optimization** paper submitted for EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing, special issue on Digital Audio Effects [1].  
This is an extension to our previous work, which you can find in the branch `dafx23` of this repository and documented in the relative DAFx paper [2].  

Main updates from the previous framework:
* Faster training, we now concentrate solely on the frequency domain
* Support for scattering feedback matrix optimization, for improved temporal density
* Synthesis of real RIR using DecayFitNet to design attenuation and tone control filters
* Support for Householder feedback matrix optimization, for reduced computational costs (not yet available in this repo)
  
## Getting started 
When cloning this repository, make sure to clone all the submodules, namely [fdnToolbox](https://github.com/SebastianJiroSchlecht/fdnToolbox) and [DecayFitNet](https://github.com/georg-goetz/DecayFitNet/tree/01daf3e7bbfd637aa1269bbca0cab7f445db0d5d), by running
```
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:gdalsanto/diff-fdn-colorless.git
```
To install the required packages using conda environments open the terminal at the repo directory and run the following command
```
conda env create -f diff-colorless-fdn-gpu.yml
```
Alternatively, use the CPU compatible environement `diff-colorless-fdn.yml`  

The optimization is coded in PyTorch. Run the `solver.py` file to launch training, the delay lines lengths must be given as arguments for the code to run. Check `solver.py` for the complete list of arguments. The initial and optimized parameters values are saved in `output/.`.  
## Demo 
The MATLAB demo code `inference.m` shows how to load the optimized FDN parameters on Sebastian Schlecht's [fdnToolbox](https://github.com/SebastianJiroSchlecht/fdnToolbox)
